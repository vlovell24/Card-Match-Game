  A match two card game for children. Includes sound effects, and animations (imported from animate.css). The game includes a score counter that gives a score of 1, for each set flipped; and an attempts counter, which keeps track of the amount of turns you took to flip all of the cards. The entire game is made in vanilla javascript, css and html.

  A Fisher-Yates shuffle is used to randomly shuffle the card backfaces, when the new game button is clicked. Once all cards are matched, a model pop's up with a new game button as well.
  
  Eventually, I plan on adding turns. Turn one for the player, and turn two for the fox. This may require that I add game modes; such as single player, or vs.
