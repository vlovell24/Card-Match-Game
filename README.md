  A match two card game for children. Includes sound effects, and animations (imported from animate.css). The game includes a score counter that gives a score of 1, for each set flipped; and a attempts counter, which keeps track of the amount of turns you took to flip all of the cards. The entire game is made is vanilla javascript, css and html.

  A Fisher-Yates shuffle is used to randomly shuffle the card backfaces, when the new game button is clicked. Once all cards are matched, a model pop's up with a new game button as well.
  
  Eventually, I plan on adding turns. Turn one for the player, and turn two for the fox. This may require that I add game modes; such as single player, or vs.
